Stage 1
Recon
- Active (Actually interacting with the website and or network of the target(Scanning Activity/Nmap or Nessus))
- Passive(Recon without actually interacting with the network.)
Scanning and Enumeration
- Pretty much the same as active recon, using tools like NMAP and Nessus to enumerate and learn more about active ports on the network, as well as details such as version or potential exploits
Gaining Access (Exploitation)
- Actually running exploits against a vulnerable service or port
- Successful access put us back to recon within the environment, as well as persistence(maintaining access)
Covering Tracks
- leaving no trace, deleting logs, clean up after yourself.
